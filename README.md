# StarWarsLCG
Star Wars LCG Website

Hi, there are two LCGs that I absolutely love Netrunner and Star Wars LCG. While Netrunner has a site called jinteki.net that allows for online play, Star Wars LCG does not. This is unfortunate and I want to change that. Unfortunately I know absolutely nothing about coding. I am going to work to fix that for the benefit of me learning a new skill, but also because I, and many other Star Wars LCG fans, want to play a well layed out online version of Star Wars LCG. If you are looking to play Star Wars LCG, or just help a community have that ability to play the game they love, I would love to have you join me in this journey.
